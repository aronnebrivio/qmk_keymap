# QMK Keybindings

This is a collection of keymaps for the [QMK Firmware](https://qmk.fm/) for keyboards I own.

## Keyboards
- [YMDK Air40](keyboards/ymdk/ymd40/air40/keymaps/aronnebrivio/README.md)

## Usage
- The [Github workflow](https://github.com/aronnebrivio/qmk_keymap/actions/workflows/build.yml) will build the firmware for each keyboard-keymap pair specified as JSON file in the `keyboards` folder.
- The firmware will be available as an artifact in the workflow run.
- Flash the firmware using the [QMK Toolbox](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_toolbox/releases) or via CLI
